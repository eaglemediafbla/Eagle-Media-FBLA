EAGLE MEDIA
See More. Do More.

This app was created for the 2021-2022 FBLA Season. 
(Created by Sidhaant Kadam & Krishna Unnam)

This is a simple and easy-to-use all-in-one app for all students.
Society is daily moving to a constant feed of communication, transfer of information, and the need to access or process information in a mobile environment. This is why we have created EAGLE MEDIA for all students to visualize their education.
This app acts as a scheduling app that, through user input, can display information on extracurricular activities, a lunch menu, the ability to email teachers and staff,
and a calendar that is updated with the school information.
The application has a simplified user interface allowing the user for a smooth experience with the app.
The app’s mission is to allow students to be able to visualize their education and take it into their own hands and as the eagle always says, “See more. Do more.”
